# Capstone Project - Loan Application Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to develop predictive models that assess the likelihood of default. The project uses data from Lending Club and includes data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling steps.

## Directory Structure
- **Capstone_App**: Contains the main application code and data for the project.
  - **app-v1**: Version 1 of the application.
    - **data**: Stores all datasets used in the project.
    - **models**: Saved machine learning models.
    - **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, processing, and modeling.
    - **src**: Source code for the application.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: Use `git clone <repository_url>` to clone this repository.
2. **Run notebooks**: Open Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to explore, preprocess, and model the data.
3. **Run the application**: Navigate to the **src** folder and run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run loanapp-streamlit.py`.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA and modeling.
- **Streamlit** for building the interactive app.
- **scikit-learn, pandas, numpy** for data processing and modeling.
